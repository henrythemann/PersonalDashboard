# PersonalDashboard
A project I created to learn React.js

Currently features a calendar widget and weather widget, but I plan to add more.

# Calendar Limitations
The calendar doesn't support multi-day events because my goal was to learn React, not to compete with Google Calendar. This lack of support for multi-day events becomes an issue if the user changes timezones. In this case, events may not show up.
