# PersonalDashboard
A fun React.js project I created.

Currently features a calendar widget and weather widget, but I plan to add more.

# Calendar Limitations
The calendar currently doesn't support multi-day events. This can become an issue if the user changes timezones. In this case, events may not show up.
